The objective of this project is to analyze housing data and build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities.


Data Loading
The dataset is loaded using data analysis libraries. It contains information like area (sq. ft.), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and sale price.


Data Understanding & Exploration
Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure of the dataset. This includes checking data types, summary statistics, and identifying patterns or trends affecting house prices.


Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


Missing values are handled using appropriate techniques (mean/median or removal).


Categorical variables such as location are converted into numerical format using encoding techniques.


Outliers are detected and treated to improve model accuracy.




Feature Selection & Engineering
Relevant features influencing house prices are selected. New features may be created (e.g., price per square foot) to enhance model performance.


Data Splitting
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.


Model Building
A regression algorithm (such as Linear Regression) is used to train the model on the training dataset to learn the relationship between features and house prices.


Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using performance metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.


Prediction
The trained model is used to predict house prices for new input data based on the learned patterns.


Conclusion
The analysis helps identify key factors affecting house prices and provides reliable price predictions, which can support decision-making in real estate.
